# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## Repository files

* __CodeBook.MD__: is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data. Read this for further details on the project.

* __README.MD__: this file.

* __run_analysis.R__: is a file containing the R programming code to perform the data analysis.

Before running the code you will need to decide where you want your working directory to be then save `run_analysis.R` to this directory. Open an R console of your choice, set the working directory to where you saved 'run_analysis.R` using the setwd() function and then execute the script by the command source("run_analysis.R").

Note that executing this script will create a "tidy_data.txt" file (in your working directory) containing the tidy data set.
